        Anecdote <br> My cousin philly(he's my second cousin) got ran over while he was driving his new little car ya
        see, and his flight got cancelled because of the moles so he had to walk home all the way down to transorg. His
        wheelchair broke and he fell at his house and he got in and saw his dog rubert cooked his smoking hot pumpkin
        seeds that I bought him last week. He injected it and he got all better!! That led me to create this site to
        help other people.
